# EXFLAME
The EXFLAME project is a research project at the University of Waikato. The aim of the project is to automate the picking and pollination of kiwifruit. This will apply to many other fruits too. The aim is to incorporate real time feedback into the motion, in order to allow for disturbances such as wind or other pickig that causes the canopy to shake.

This project is adjusted and continued on from the FLAME project, as the overall goal has changed slightly. The existing FLAME code is kept in the FLAME directory as a backup and for historical purposes.
