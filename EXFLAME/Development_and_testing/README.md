# Develpoment and Testing
This directory contains versions of the python and C++ codes that were used while developing and testing the basler cameras for stereo matching.

The codes have been kept here for backup and archiving.

## cpp_codes
Mostly focuses on running the baslers, calibration, testing stereo matching, testing kiwifruit detection, testing using the gpu, testing errors, and testing ros messaging.

## python_codes
Earlier codes while still learning, before switching to implement in C++. Also has a 3D point cloud sender for viewing using ros.

## ethernet_trials
Code used to learn and test how ethernet communication worked, before implementing in the [ethernet version of the canopy control code](../Canopy_Control/Ethernet_Communication).

## Camera_Calibration
Early camera calibration results from matlab and other useful parts associated with the calibration.
